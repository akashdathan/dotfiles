Position your cursor on a bracket (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, or `}`)\n2. Press `%`\n3. Your cursor will jump to the matching bracket\n\nThis works in both directions - from opening to closing bracket and vice versa.\n\n## Moving to specific brackets\n\n- `[(` - Jump to previous unmatched `(`\n- `])` - Jump to next unmatched `)`\n- `[{` - Jump to previous unmatched `{`\n- `]}` - Jump to next unmatched `}`\n- `[[` - Jump to beginning of current/previous function\n- `]]` - Jump to beginning of next function\n\n## Using plugins\n\nFor enhanced bracket navigation:\n- **vim-matchup**: Extended `%` functionality\n- **delimitMate**: Auto-completion for quotes, parentheses, brackets\n\n## Setting up bracket highlighting\n\nAdd to your `.vimrc`:\n```vim\nset showmatch       \" Briefly jump to matching bracket\nset matchtime=1     \" Tenths of a second to show match\n```\n\nThese commands will make Vim briefly highlight matching brackets when your cursor is on one of them.\n\n\ncan you tell me what each symbol does\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":674}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":121},"start":39,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":675}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":122},"start":1241,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":676}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":185},"start":1282,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":677}}}],"summary":"VIM Jump Between Brackets","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
