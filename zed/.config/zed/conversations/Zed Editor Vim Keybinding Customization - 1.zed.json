Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open Zed's Settings:\n   - Use Cmd+, (Mac) or Ctrl+, (Windows/Linux)\n   - Or click on the menu: Settings â†’ Open Key Bindings\n\n2. Add these key bindings to your configuration:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key\": \"H\",\n    \"command\": \"move_to_line_start\",\n    \"when\": \"editor.focus\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": \"L\",\n    \"command\": \"move_to_line_end\",\n    \"when\": \"editor.focus\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nNote: If you have existing key bindings, make sure to add these within the existing array, separated by commas.\n\nThese bindings will make:\n- H: move to the start of the line\n- L: move to the end of the line\n\nRemember that this will override any existing functionality of the H and L keys in normal mode if you're using Vim keybindings.\ncan i map other vim keys to the keys like ^ and #\n\nYes, you can map other Vim keys to Zed commands. Here's how you can map various Vim-style movements:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key\": \"shift+6\", // This is ^\n    \"command\": \"move_to_first_non_whitespace\",\n    \"when\": \"editor.focus\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": \"shift+4\", // This is $\n    \"command\": \"move_to_line_end\",\n    \"when\": \"editor.focus\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": \"shift+3\", // This is #\n    \"command\": \"search_for_word_backward\",\n    \"when\": \"editor.focus\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"key\": \"shift+8\", // This is *\n    \"command\": \"search_for_word_forward\",\n    \"when\": \"editor.focus\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nCommon Vim-style mappings you might want to add:\n- `^` (shift+6): Move to first non-whitespace character\n- `$` (shift+4): Move to end of line\n- `#` (shift+3): Search for word under cursor backward\n- `*` (shift+8): Search for word under cursor forward\n- `0`: Move to absolute beginning of line\n\nNote: The exact commands and their availability may depend on your version of Zed as the editor is still evolving. You can check the available commands in Zed's command palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P) to see what commands you can map to.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":505}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":76},"start":95,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":506}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":77},"start":963,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":507}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":162},"start":1014,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":508}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":163},"start":2110,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":509}}}],"summary":"Zed Editor Vim Keybinding Customization","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
