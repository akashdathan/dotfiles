It's called `useIsPublicPath` and follows the React hook naming convention (starting with \"use\"). \n\nThis custom hook:\n1. Uses the built-in `useLocation` hook from `react-router-dom` to get the current URL path\n2. Compares the current path with a list of public paths defined in `ENDPOINTS_PUBLIC`\n3. Returns a boolean indicating whether the current path is in the list of public paths\n\nThis hook would be used in functional components to determine if the current page should be treated as a public path.\nis it dynamic?\nYes, this hook is dynamic in the sense that:\n\n1. It reactively responds to changes in the URL path. When the location changes (user navigates to a different route), the `useLocation` hook will return a new location object with the updated pathname.\n\n2. The result of `useIsPublicPath()` will automatically update based on the current route, so any component using this hook will re-render when the user navigates between public and non-public paths.\n\nThis is one of the key benefits of React hooks - they integrate with React's rendering cycle to provide dynamic, reactive behavior without requiring manual subscription management.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1070}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":348,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1071}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":879,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1072}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":47},"start":894,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1073}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":48},"start":1526,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1074}}}],"summary":"React Hook for Public Path","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":330},"icon":"File","label":"atom-web/src/browser/providers/public-path-config.ts","metadata":{"path":"atom-web/src/browser/providers/public-path-config.ts"}}]}
