It moves the cursor to the window on the left of the current window.\n\nThis is part of Vim's window navigation commands where:\n- `Ctrl-w h` - move to the window on the left\n- `Ctrl-w j` - move to the window below\n- `Ctrl-w k` - move to the window above\n- `Ctrl-w l` - move to the window on the right\n\nThese commands are useful when you have multiple split windows open in Vim and want to move between them.
