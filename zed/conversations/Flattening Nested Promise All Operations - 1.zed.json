Uses `flatMap` to transform each subprojectPhase into an array of two promises\n2. The arrays get flattened into a single array of all promises\n3. `Promise.all` then waits for all promises to resolve\n\nSo if you had 3 subprojectPhases, instead of having 3 nested Promise.all calls, you'll have one Promise.all waiting on 6 promises (2 per subprojectPhase).\n\nBoth versions achieve the same result, but this version is cleaner and more straightforward.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":167}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":158},"start":361,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":168}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":159},"start":1098,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":169}}}],"summary":"Flattening Nested Promise All Operations","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
