Here's how:\n\n```bash\n# The safer option (recommended)\ngit push --force-with-lease\n\n# Or the standard force push\ngit push -f\n```\n\nImportant notes:\n1. `--force-with-lease` is safer because it will fail if someone else has pushed changes to the branch in the meantime\n2. Be very careful with force pushing as it rewrites history\n3. Only use this on branches you're working on alone\n4. Never force push to main/master branches in shared repositories\n5. Make sure your team is aware when you force push\n\nIf you're working on a shared branch, it's usually better to create a new commit instead of modifying history.\n\nBefore force pushing, double-check that you're on the correct branch and that overwriting history is really what you want to do.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":139}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":30},"start":147,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":140}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":1043,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":141}}}],"summary":"Overwriting Pushed Git Commit History","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
