It covers the main requirements for tracking role requests and approvals. Here are my observations:\n\n### Good aspects:\n- You've included all essential fields: user, role, justification, status, and tracking fields\n- The status enum with 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected' values is appropriate\n- Foreign key constraints are properly set up\n- You've thoughtfully included separate `user_id` and `created_by` fields to handle cases where someone creates a request on behalf of another user\n\n### Suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. The `update_ts` field should have a default value to automatically update when records change:\n   ```sql\n   `update_ts` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n   ```\n\n2. Consider adding an `approver_id` field to track who approved/rejected the request:\n   ```sql\n   `approver_id` INT UNSIGNED NULL,\n   CONSTRAINT `fk_user_role_request_approver_id` FOREIGN KEY (`approver_id`) REFERENCES `new_user` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE,\n   ```\n\n3. You might want to add a `response_note` field for the approver to provide feedback:\n   ```sql\n   `response_note` MEDIUMTEXT NULL,\n   ```\n\nThese suggestions would make the schema more complete for your workflow, but the current schema is functional as-is and covers the basic requirements you described.\nit cannot be approver id , since it could be approve or reject\nYou're right, that's an important distinction. Since the action can be either approval or rejection, a more appropriate field name would be `reviewer_id` or `response_by`. Here's the corrected suggestion:\n\n```sql\n`response_by` INT UNSIGNED NULL,\n`response_ts` TIMESTAMP NULL,\n\n`response_note` MEDIUMTEXT NULL,\nCONSTRAINT `fk_user_role_request_response_by` FOREIGN KEY (`response_by`) REFERENCES `new_user` (`id`) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE,\n```\n\nThis way, you're capturing:\n- Who responded to the request (approved or rejected)\n- When they responded\n- Any notes/comments they provided with their decision\n\nThe status field still indicates whether the response was an approval or rejection, so this approach covers both possible actions.\nin ddd, should user_role be in the user domain or a saperate domain\n\n## User Roles in DDD: Domain Placement Considerations\n\nIn Domain-Driven Design, the placement of user roles depends on what roles represent in your business domain. There are two main approaches:\n\n### Option 1: User Domain\nIf roles primarily represent user attributes or capabilities within the system (like \"admin,\" \"editor,\" \"viewer\"), they can be part of the User domain.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Simplifies user management\n- Keeps user-related concepts together\n- Makes sense when roles exist primarily to control what users can do\n\n**When to choose:** If roles are primarily about user classification and access control.\n\n### Option 2: Separate Domain\nIf roles represent significant business concepts with their own lifecycle and rules (like \"Manager,\" \"Physician,\" \"Financial Analyst\"), consider a separate domain.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Better reflects complex organizational structures\n- Allows roles to evolve independently from users\n- Supports complex permission models and role hierarchies\n\n**When to choose:** If roles have rich behavior, complex relationships, or are fundamental organization concepts rather than just system permissions.\n\n### Best Practice\nLook at your ubiquitous language: Do your domain experts talk about roles as properties of users, or as independent concepts? This can guide your decision.\n\nFor many systems, a separate \"Identity and Access Management\" bounded context that includes both users and roles is common, especially as systems grow more complex.\n```ts atom-web/src/server/new-structure/domain/permission/entities/role-request.entity.ts\n```\n\n\n```ts
