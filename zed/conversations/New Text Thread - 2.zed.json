Using `git branch`:\n```bash\ngit branch new-branch-name\n```\nThen switch to the new branch:\n```bash\ngit checkout new-branch-name\n```\n\n2. Using `git checkout` with the `-b` flag (creates and switches in one command):\n```bash\ngit checkout -b new-branch-name\n```\n\n3. Using `git switch` with the `-c` flag (newer Git versions):\n```bash\ngit switch -c new-branch-name\n```\n\nAll these methods will:\n- Create a new branch from your current branch\n- The new branch will point to the same commit where you currently are\n- The contents will be exactly the same as your current branch\n\nExample:\n```bash\n# If you're on main branch and want to create a feature branch\ngit checkout -b feature/new-feature\n\n# Or using git switch\ngit switch -c feature/new-feature\n```\n\nAfter creating the branch, you can verify your current branch with:\n```bash\ngit branch\n```\nThe current branch will be marked with an asterisk (*).\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":65,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":33}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":1044,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":34}}}],"summary":"New Text Thread","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
