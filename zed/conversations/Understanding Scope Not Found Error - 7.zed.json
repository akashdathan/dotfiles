Here's the issue:\n\n1. You collect scope IDs with: \n   ```javascript\n   _.compact(documentsRevisions.map(({ revision }) => revision.linkScopeIDs.at(0)))\n   ```\n\n2. The `_.compact()` function removes falsy values (null, undefined, 0, \"\", false) from the array.\n\n3. Then you query the repository with only these non-falsy IDs:\n   ```javascript\n   await this.scopeRepo.getByIDs(...)\n   ```\n\n4. But later in your mapping function, you're checking for a scope for any revision that has `linkScopeIDs.length > 0`, regardless of whether that ID was included in the query.\n\nWhen a revision has a non-empty `linkScopeIDs` array, but the first ID is falsy (null, undefined, etc.), it would be excluded from the query, but you'd still try to find it in the `scopes` array.\n\nTo fix this, you could:\n\n1. Either modify your condition to check if a scope was actually queried:\n   ```javascript\n   const scopeID = revision.linkScopeIDs[0];\n   if (!scopeID) return { document, revision, format: revision.format };\n   ```\n\n2. Or remove the `_.compact()` and handle potentially falsy IDs in your repository method.\n\n\n\n\nbut its the db it, it wont be falsy, also the scope have to be not null since i have a foreign key\nconstraint fk_scope_node_scope\n       foreign key (scope_id) references scope (scope_id)\n           on update cascade on delete cascade\nYou're right - if there's a foreign key constraint in your database, then the scope IDs should always reference valid entries in the scope table.\n\nGiven this information, a scope not being found could only happen in a few scenarios:\n\n1. **Race condition**: If another process deleted the scope between the time you retrieved the document revision and when you queried for scopes. However, with your `on delete cascade` constraint, this would likely delete the referring record too.\n\n2. **Database inconsistency**: Sometimes databases can become inconsistent if constraints weren't always enforced (maybe they were added later) or if there were issues during data migration.\n\n3. **Repository implementation**: There could be an issue with how `scopeRepo.getByIDs()` works - perhaps it doesn't return all requested scopes or has a filtering mechanism that excludes some results.\n\n4. **Caching issues**: If your application uses caching, there might be stale data.\n\nTo make your code more robust without throwing an error, you could update it to handle this (unlikely but possible) case more gracefully:\n\n```javascript\nreturn {\n  document,\n  revision,\n  format: revision.format,\n  scope: scope ? {\n    id: revision.linkScopeIDs[0],\n    title: scope.title,\n  } : null,\n};\n```\n\nThis way, if a scope is mysteriously not found despite the foreign key constraint, your code won't throw an error but will return a null scope object.\nat(0) an d [0] provides the same result right? bacause there could be different scopes linked, we are only getting the first one\n\nYes, `at(0)` and `[0]` would provide the same result when accessing the first element of an array. The main difference is how they handle out-of-bounds scenarios:\n\n- `[0]` returns `undefined` when the array is empty or the index is out of bounds\n- `at(0)` also returns `undefined` for empty arrays, but has the advantage of supporting negative indices (e.g., `at(-1)` gets the last element)\n\nIn your specific case where you're just accessing the first element of `linkScopeIDs`, both approaches are functionally equivalent. You're correctly understanding that there could be multiple scopes linked, and you're intentionally just getting the first one with either method.\n\nSince you're only interested in the first scope ID and handling it consistently whether using `at(0)` or `[0]`, your approach is correct.\nbut then how can it throw the EntityNotFoundError\n\nYou're right to question this. Based on your foreign key constraint and the logic of your code, it shouldn't be possible to get that `EntityNotFoundError`. Let's explore what might be happening:\n\nLooking at this part of your code:\n\n```javascript\nconst scope = scopes.find((scope) => scope.id === revision.linkScopeIDs[0]);\nif (!scope) throw new EntityNotFoundError(\"Scope\");\n```\n\nThis error would only be thrown if:\n\n1. `revision.linkScopeIDs[0]` exists (i.e., the array is not empty)\n2. But no matching scope was found in the `scopes` array\n\nGiven your database constraints, this shouldn't happen. Let me suggest a few things to check:\n\n1. **Property name mismatch**: Make sure the scope object's ID property is actually named `id` and not something like `scopeId` or `_id`\n\n2. **Type mismatch**: The ID in `revision.linkScopeIDs[0]` might be a different type than in `scope.id` (e.g., string vs number)\n\n3. **Inconsistent data structure**: Check if `revision.linkScopeIDs` always contains scope IDs that match the IDs in your scope table\n\n4. **Repository behavior**: Verify that `scopeRepo.getByIDs()` is correctly fetching all requested IDs\n\nTo debug this specific issue, you could add some logging before the error:\n\n```javascript\nconst scopeId = revision.linkScopeIDs[0];\nconst scope = scopes.find((scope) => scope.id === scopeId);\nif (!scope) {\n  console.log(`Failed to find scope with ID: ${scopeId}`);\n  console.log(`Available scope IDs: ${scopes.map(s => s.id).join(', ')}`);\n  throw new EntityNotFoundError(\"Scope\");\n}\n```\n\nThis would help you identify whether there's a mismatch between the IDs you're looking for and the ones you've retrieved.\n```ts atom-web/src/server/new-structure/application/repositories/scope.repo.ts\nimport { Prisma } from

potential issue that could explain why you're getting EntityNotFoundError.\n\nIn your `getByIDs` method, you have this check:\n\n```typescript\nif (dbScopes.length !== scopeIDs.length) {\n  throw new EntityNotFoundError(\"Scope\");\n}\n```\n\nThis means if you request 5 scope IDs but the database only returns 4 matching scopes, it will throw an EntityNotFoundError. This would happen even though you found SOME of the scopes successfully.\n\nThis explains why your original code fails - when you do:\n\n```typescript\nconst scopes = await this.scopeRepo.getByIDs(\n  _.compact(documentsRevisions.map(({ revision }) => revision.linkScopeIDs.at(0)))\n);\n```\n\nIf even ONE of the requested scope IDs isn't found (due to permissions, location filtering, or data inconsistency), the entire query fails with EntityNotFoundError.\n\nFurthermore, your `getByIDs` method has a `locationID` parameter that could be filtering results:\n\n```typescript\nwhere: {\n  AND: [\n    accessibleBy(this.authzService.getUserAbility(), \"read\").scope,\n    {\n      scope_id: { in: scopeIDs },\n      location_id: locationID,\n    },\n  ],\n},\n```\n\nIf this parameter is provided and some of your scopes have different location IDs, those scopes won't be returned.\n\nAnother factor is the `accessibleBy` check, which means if the user doesn't have permission to read some of the requested scopes, those won't be returned.\n\nTo fix this, you have a few options:\n\n1. Change your `getByIDs` method to not throw an error when some scopes aren't found\n2. Handle the error in your calling code\n3. Make sure all requested scope IDs are valid and accessible to the current user\n\nThe simplest change would be to modify your repository method to return whatever scopes it can find rather than throwing an error:\n\n```typescript\nasync getByIDs(scopeIDs: number[], locationID?: number): Promise<PersistedScope[]> {\n  if (scopeIDs.length === 0) return [];\n\n  const dbScopes = await this.db.scope.findMany({\n    where: {\n      AND: [\n        accessibleBy(this.authzService.getUserAbility(), \"read\").scope,\n        {\n          scope_id: {\n            in: scopeIDs,\n          },\n          location_id: locationID,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n    include: scopeQueryInclude,\n  });\n\n  // Removed the check that throws an error\n  return dbScopes.map(ScopeMap.toDomain);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, your original code will work without errors, but you'll need to handle the case where a scope isn't found in your mapping function.\nwhat if findMany has duplicate scope ids\nThe `findMany` query in Prisma won't return duplicate results for the same scope ID. When you provide an `in` filter with an array of IDs like this:\n\n```typescript\nscope_id: {\n  in: scopeIDs,\n}\n```\n\nPrisma will generate a SQL query that includes a `WHERE scope_id IN (...)` clause. This will return at most one row per unique ID in the database.\n\nEven if you pass duplicate IDs in your `scopeIDs` array (like `[1, 2, 2, 3]`), you'll still get back only one record per existing scope ID from the database.\n\nIf you're concerned about duplicate IDs in your input array, you could always deduplicate them before querying:\n\n```typescript\nasync getByIDs(scopeIDs: number[], locationID?: number): Promise<PersistedScope[]> {\n  if (scopeIDs.length === 0) return [];\n  \n  // Remove duplicate IDs\n  const uniqueScopeIDs = [...new Set(scopeIDs)];\n  \n  const dbScopes = await this.db.scope.findMany({\n    where: {\n      AND: [\n        accessibleBy(this.authzService.getUserAbility(), \"read\").scope,\n        {\n          scope_id: {\n            in: uniqueScopeIDs, // Using deduplicated array\n          },\n          location_id: locationID,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n    include: scopeQueryInclude,\n  });\n\n  return dbScopes.map(ScopeMap.toDomain);\n}\n```\n\nBut this is not strictly necessary just for the query itself, as duplicate IDs in the filter won't cause duplicate results.\n\nso if i pas duplicate ids, the result count will not be the same and the error could be thrown right?\nExactly! That's a crucial insight. \n\nIf you pass duplicate IDs in your `scopeIDs` array (like `[1, 1, 2, 3]`), your code will expect to get back 4 results. But since databases will only return unique records, you'd get just 3 results (one for each unique ID).\n\nYour current check:\n```typescript\nif (dbScopes.length !== scopeIDs.length) {\n  throw new EntityNotFoundError(\"Scope\");\n}\n```\n\nWill throw an error in this case, because `dbScopes.length` (3) won't match `scopeIDs.length` (4).\n\nTo fix this, you have two options:\n\n1. Deduplicate the IDs before comparing lengths:\n```typescript\nconst uniqueScopeIDs = [...new Set(scopeIDs)];\nif (dbScopes.length !== uniqueScopeIDs.length) {\n  throw new EntityNotFoundError(\"Scope\");\n}\n```\n\n2. Or better yet, check that every requested ID has a corresponding scope:\n```typescript\nconst foundIDs = new Set(dbScopes.map(scope => scope.scope_id));\nconst missingAnyID = scopeIDs.some(id => !foundIDs.has(id));\nif (missingAnyID) {\n  throw new EntityNotFoundError(\"Scope\");\n}\n```\n\nThis second approach handles both duplicate IDs and ensures all requested IDs were found.\n\ndoes the compact function remove duplicates?\nNo, `_.compact()` (from Lodash) does not remove duplicates. \n\n`_.compact()` only removes \"falsy\" values from an array. In JavaScript, falsy values include:\n- `null`\n- `undefined`\n- `0`\n- `''` (empty string)\n- `NaN`\n- `false`\n\nFor example:\n```javascript\n_.compact([0, 1, false, 2, '', 3, null, undefined, NaN, 4])\n// Returns: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nIt will not remove duplicate values:\n```javascript\n_.compact([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])\n// Returns: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3] (duplicates remain)\n```\n\nIf you need to remove duplicates, you could use:\n1. `_.uniq()` from Lodash: `_.uniq(yourArray)`\n2. Or with vanilla JavaScript: `[...new Set(yourArray)]`\n\nFor your specific case, if you need to both remove falsy values AND deduplicate:\n```javascript\n_.uniq(_.compact(documentsRevisions.map(({ revision }) => revision.linkScopeIDs.at(0))))\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":9421}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":56},"start":875,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":9422}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":247},"start":2111,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":{"Error":"The final message must be from the user.
