This is possible because:\n\n1. **Context-sensitive parsing**: Zed's parser determines the meaning of a word based on its position and usage in the code.\n\n2. **Reduced reserved word list**: This approach minimizes the number of truly reserved words in the language, giving programmers more flexibility in naming.\n\n3. **Practical usage**: It allows using natural names in contexts where those words make sense as identifiers (e.g., using `type` as a variable name when discussing types).\n\n## Example\n\n```\n// 'type' as a keyword\ntype Person = {name: string, age: int64}\n\n// 'type' as an identifier\nfunction get_type(obj) {\n  type = typeof(obj)\n  return type\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is similar to languages like Rust, where context determines whether a word is used as a keyword or identifier, providing flexibility while maintaining readability.\nji mean the zed editor\n\n# Zed Editor's Keywords vs. Identifiers\n\nI apologize for the confusion. You're asking about the Zed code editor, not the Zed programming language.\n\nIn the Zed editor, there's indeed no distinction between some keywords and identifiers in its syntax highlighting. This is primarily because:\n\n## Why Zed Editor Doesn't Distinguish Some Keywords\n\n1. **Minimalist Design Philosophy**: Zed follows a clean, minimalist approach to UI and syntax highlighting, prioritizing readability without excessive color variation.\n\n2. **Language-Specific Highlighting**: Zed's syntax highlighting is language-specific, and some languages may have context-dependent keywords that are difficult to universally highlight differently from identifiers.\n\n3. **Performance Considerations**: More simplified syntax highlighting rules can contribute to Zed's focus on performance and responsiveness.\n\n4. **User Customization**: Zed allows users to customize themes and syntax highlighting, so users who prefer more distinction can often modify these settings.\n\nIf you're finding this limiting for your workflow, you might want to check Zed's theme settings or create a custom theme that provides the level of distinction you prefer between keywords and identifiers.\n```ts atom-web/src/server/new-structure/domain/scope/repos/scope.repo.ts\nimport { IBaseRepo } from \"../../../framework/infrastructure/base-repo\";\nimport { PersistedScope, Scope } from \"../entities/scope.entity\";\nimport { User } from \"@atom/types\";\n\nexport interface IScopeRepo extends IBaseRepo {\n  save(scope: Scope): Promise<void>;\n  getByID(scopeID: number): Promise<PersistedScope | undefined>;\n  getByIDOrThrow(scopeID: number): Promise<PersistedScope>;\n  getByIDs(scopeIDs: number[], locationID?: number): Promise<Scope[]>;\n  getScopeSupplierUserIDs(scopeID: number): Promise<User.ID[]>;\n  getScopeStakeholderUserIDs(scopeID: number): Promise<User.ID[]>;\n}\n```\n\n\nwhy are the colors different for export and interface in vscode and same color in zed editor?\n\n# Syntax Highlighting Differences: VSCode vs. Zed\n\nThe color difference you're noticing between VSCode and Zed for TypeScript keywords like `export` and `interface` stems from their different approaches to syntax highlighting:\n\n## VSCode's Approach\n\nIn VSCode, different types of keywords are categorized more granularly:\n- **`export`** is highlighted as a module keyword (often blue in default themes)\n- **`interface`** is highlighted as a type declaration keyword (often light blue or another distinct color)\n\nVSCode uses TextMate grammar with a detailed token classification system that distinguishes between different types of keywords based on their semantic function.\n\n## Zed's Approach\n\nZed uses a more simplified syntax highlighting system:\n- Both **`export`** and **`interface`** are likely categorized under the same generic \"keyword\" token type\n- This results in them having the same color in the editor\n\nZed's highlighting is designed to be minimal and performant, with fewer distinct token categories than VSCode's more elaborate system.\n\n## Why This Difference Exists\n\n1. **Design Philosophy**: Zed prioritizes a cleaner, less distracting color palette with fewer distinctions\n2. **Technical Implementation**: Zed uses Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting, which might have a different tokenization approach compared to VSCode's TextMate grammar\n3. **Performance Considerations**: Fewer token types can be more efficient to render\n\nIf you prefer VSCode's more granular highlighting, you might explore custom themes in Zed, though it may not offer the same level of token differentiation as VSCode's system.\n:j","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":841}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":111},"start":78,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":842}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":112},"start":1309,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":843}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":149},"start":1333,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":844}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":150},"start":2572,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":845}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":439},"start":3336,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":846}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":440},"start":4956,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":847}}}],"summary":"Zed Keyword and Identifier Indistinction","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":2572,"end":3239},"icon":"File","label":"atom-web/src/server/new-structure/domain/scope/repos/scope.repo.ts","metadata":{"path":"atom-web/src/server/new-structure/domain/scope/repos/scope.repo.ts"}}]}
