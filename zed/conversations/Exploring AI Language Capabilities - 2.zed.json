Zed is a real-time collaborative code editor built by Uber Technologies, similar in function to VS Code but designed for remote collaboration. Here are some common shortcuts and tips to enhance your workflow:\n\n### Navigation\n- **Cmd + P (Mac) / Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux):** Quick open files.\n- **Cmd + [ or ] (Mac) / Ctrl + [ or ] (Windows/Linux):** Navigate back and forth through your file history.\n\n### Editing\n- **Cmd + X (Mac) / Ctrl + X (Windows/Linux):** Cut line(s).\n- **Cmd + C (Mac) / Ctrl + C (Windows/Linux):** Copy line(s).\n- **Cmd + V (Mac) / Ctrl + V (Windows/Linux):** Paste line(s).\n- **Cmd + Shift + L (Mac) / Ctrl + Shift + L (Windows/Linux):** Select all occurrences of the current word.\n- **Cmd + / (Mac) / Ctrl + / (Windows/Linux):** Toggle comment on the selected line(s).\n\n### Cursor and Selection\n- **Alt + Click:** Place multiple cursors.\n- **Shift + Alt + Up/Down Arrow (Mac) / Shift + Alt + Up/Down Arrow (Windows/Linux):** Add cursor to the same position in the previous or next line.\n\n### Collaboration\n- **Click on a user\ni am using zed in vim mode, if i am coming from lazyvim, whats the best keymaps i can use\nCertainly! Zed is a collaborative coding environment that integrates well with Vim. Since you're transitioning from LazyVim, here are some useful Vim-style key mappings for Zed that might enhance your workflow:\n\n### Navigation\n\n- **Normal Mode Shortcuts:**\n  - `j`, `k`: Navigate through the buffer (like in normal Vim)\n  - `h`, `l`, `0`, `$`: Movement across lines and positions within a line\n  - `gg`: Go to the beginning of the file\n  - `G`: Go to the end of the file\n\n- **Window Navigation:**\n  - `<C-w> h/j/k/l`: Move between split windows in Zed (these mimic Vim's window navigation)\n  \n### Editing\n\n- **Text Manipulation:**\n  - `dd`: Delete a line\n  - `yy`: Yank (copy) a line\n  - `p`, `P`: Paste after/before the cursor\n  - `cw`: Change word\n  \n- **Search and Replace:**\n  - `/pattern` or `?pattern`: Search forward/backward for pattern\n  - `n`, `N`: Move to next/previous search result\n\n### Folding\n\n- **Code Folding (if supported):**\n  - `zc`, `zo`: Close/open a fold at the current line\n  - `za`: Toggle fold open/close\n  - `zr`, `zm`: Decrease/increase fold level\n\n### Customization\n\nSince you're familiar with LazyVim, you might want to incorporate some of its custom key mappings. Here's how:\n\n1. **Open Zed Keymap Configuration:**\n   You can typically adjust key mappings in a configuration file or through settings specific to your IDE setup.\n\n2. **Import from LazyVim (if applicable):**\n   If there are specific customizations in LazyVim that you find invaluable, check if they're compatible with Vim modes in Zed and import them accordingly.\n\n3. **Customize Through `.vimrc` or Similar Configurations:**\n   Consider creating a Vim configuration file where your key mappings are defined. This can usually be linked to IDE configurations through the settings menu.\n\n### Tips for Efficiency\n\n- **Practice the Basics:** As you're accustomed to LazyVim, much of Vim's core navigation should feel intuitive.\n  \n- **Consistent Practice:** Spend time getting familiar with Zed’s specific behaviors in combination with your key mappings to enhance muscle memory.\n\n- **Explore Plugins:** Some plugins might offer additional functionality for collaborative tools like Zed. Check out if any plugins can be integrated into your setup for a smoother transition.\n\nFeel free to adjust these keymaps according to your preferences or based on the specific features you prioritize!
